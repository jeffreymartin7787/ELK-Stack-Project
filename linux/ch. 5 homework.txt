### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:

Tar -xvf TarDocs.tar

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:

tar -czf Javaless_Doc.tar --exclude "TarDocs/Documents/Java" TarDocs/Documents

3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:

tar -tvf Javaless_Doc.tar

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:

#### Critical Analysis Question

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?

You wouldn't use the options together because -x extracts an item from the archive while -c creates a new tar archive. It is not possible to create a new tar archive and to extract that tar archvie at the same time.

### Step 2: Create, Manage, and Automate Cron Jobs

1. Cron job for backing up the `/var/log/auth.log` file:

0 6 * * WED tar -zcvf /auth_backup.tgz /var/log/auth.log

---

### Step 3: Write Basic Bash Scripts

1. Brace expansion command to create the four subdirectories:

mkdir ~/backups/{freedisk,freemem,diskuse,openlist}

2. Paste your `system.sh` script edits below:

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
    
# Free memory output to a free_mem.txt file
free -h > ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt


# Disk usage output to a disk_usage.txt file
du -h > ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt


# List open files to a open_list.txt file
lsof /dev/null > ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt

# Free disk space to a free_disk.txt file
df -h > ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt

    ```

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:
chmod u+x system.sh

**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:
sudo ./system.sh

cat ~/backups/diskuse/disk_usage.txt
cat ~/backups/freemem/free_mem.txt
cat ~/backups/openlist/open_list.txt
cat ~/backups/freedisk/free_disk.txt

**Bonus**
- Command to copy `system` to system-wide cron directory:

---

### Step 4. Manage Log File Sizes
 
1. Run `sudo nano /etc/logrotate.conf` to edit the `logrotate` configuration file. 

    Configure a log rotation scheme that backs up authentication messages to the `/var/log/auth.log`.

    - Add your config file edits below:

   /var/log/auth.log {
        weekly
        rotate 7
        notifempty
        delay compression
        missingok

}


---

### Bonus: Check for Policy and File Violations

1. Command to verify `auditd` is active:

2. Command to set number of retained logs and maximum log file size:

    - Add the edits made to the configuration file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

3. Command using `auditd` to set rules for `/etc/shadow`, `/etc/passwd` and `/var/log/auth.log`:


    - Add the edits made to the `rules` file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution edits here]
    ```

4. Command to restart `auditd`:

5. Command to list all `auditd` rules:

6. Command to produce an audit report:

7. Create a user with `sudo useradd attacker` and produce an audit report that lists account modifications:

8. Command to use `auditd` to watch `/var/log/cron`:

9. Command to verify `auditd` rules:

---

### Bonus (Research Activity): Perform Various Log Filtering Techniques

1. Command to return `journalctl` messages with priorities from emergency to error:

1. Command to check the disk usage of the system journal unit since the most recent boot:

1. Comand to remove all archived journal files except the most recent two:


1. Command to filter all log messages with priority levels between zero and two, and save output to `/home/sysadmin/Priority_High.txt`:

1. Command to automate the last command in a daily cronjob. Add the edits made to the crontab file below:

    ```bash
    [Your solution cron edits here]
    ```

### Step 1: Create, Extract, Compress, and Manage tar Backup Archives

1. Command to **extract** the `TarDocs.tar` archive to the current directory:
tar -xf TarDocs.tar 

2. Command to **create** the `Javaless_Doc.tar` archive from the `TarDocs/` directory, while excluding the `TarDocs/Documents/Java` directory:
tar --exclude "TarDocs/Documents/Java" -cvf Javaless_Doc.tar TarDocs/


3. Command to ensure `Java/` is not in the new `Javaless_Docs.tar` archive:
grep /Java/ Javaless_Docs.tar  

**Bonus** 
- Command to create an incremental archive called `logs_backup_tar.gz` with only changed files to `snapshot.file` for the `/var/log` directory:

- Why wouldn't you use the options `-x` and `-c` at the same time with `tar`?

-x would execute while -c would create, but when you first execute it then it will create it so this will create a duplicate directory.

3. Command to make the `system.sh` script executable:
bash system.sh

**Optional**
- Commands to test the script and confirm its execution:
